# Diabetics_Prediction
Diabetics prediction using SVM
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. The model is built using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in classification tasks.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python (version >= 3.6)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
## Model Evaluation
The performance of the SVM model is evaluated using various classification metrics such as accuracy. This metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to predict diabetes in patients.
